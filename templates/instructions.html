    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this experiment, you will make decisions about business scenarios. For each case:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll make an initial decision and report your confidence</li>
        <li>You'll receive AI advice</li>
        <li>You can revise your decision and confidence</li>
        <li>You can choose to trust the advice or fact-check it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payment Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Base payment: €5 for participation</li>
        <li>Bonus: Up to €{{ TOTAL_BONUS_PER_CASE }} per case ({{ NUM_CASES_PER_PARTICIPANT }} cases total)</li>
        <li>Fact-checking costs: {{ FACT_CHECK_COST_RATE * 100 }}% of your current bonus for that case</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>Your bonus is calculated using a Quadratic Scoring Rule based on your confidence and whether your decision was correct. The more accurate your confidence assessment, the higher your bonus.</p>
